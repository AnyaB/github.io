Here are some of my projects:

PeaceEd
* General Idea: Here a client asked me to summarize her high school survey data using numbers and percentages of 
students who answered a range of peace education questions. I've included just the first question 
to demonstrate subsetting. The high schools are listed using the mascots: Cards, Hawks, Jays, and Eagles. For reporting, the client requested certain schools be grouped together.
