Here are some of my projects:

Subsetting Highschool Survey Data
* General Idea: Here a client asked me to summarize her high school survey data using numbers and percentages of 
students who answered a range of peace education questions. I've included just the first few questions 
to demonstrate subsetting. The high schools are listed as DHS, LHS, HHS, and CHS. For reporting, the client 
requested certain schools be grouped together. 
* Still needs: I'm working on formatting the output to include fewer digits and better headings for readability.
